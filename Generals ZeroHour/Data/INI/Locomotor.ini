; it may seem odd to have a "bomb" with a Locomotor, especially a Thrust locomotor,
; but there's a good reason: the Aurora moves so freakin' fast that it's really
; hard to (1) find a reliable drop location, and (2) actually get it close enough to
; that location. So we cheat: just get fairly close, then let the "bomb" do a little (subtle)
; navigation on the way down. This works pretty well and actually looks much better
