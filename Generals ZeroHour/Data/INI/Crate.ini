; This file holds both the CrateData structures that define the conditions
; for creating a crate and the Objects that represent Crates in the game world
; which are simply Objects with CrateCollide modules.

; A CrateData name is what a CrateDie module will reference in its DieData.
; A Crate is an Object referenced by a CrateData in the CrateObject field to get created on success.
; CreationChance is the only Condition that is mandatory, since it defaults to zero.

; Below the definitions of CrateData are the actual Crate Objects.  The only important parts there are the
; name of the model, the type of Collide module, and the data to that module.

; Also included is a sample Die module that must be added to the object in Faction*.ini.
; The CrateData entry is what connects the crate listings here to the objects that make them.

; Multiple CrateData entries mean AND, multiple CrateObject entries mean OR.   
; Remember that, it will make total sense in a minute.

; -=-=-=-=-=-=- EXAMPLE -=-=-=-=-=-=-
; ***Give this Die Module to whomever you want to produce a crate on death

;Behavior = CreateCrateDie
;; CrateData = TestCrate    ; These listings are not guarantees, the Conditions are in the CrateData
; CrateData = TestCrate2  ; These independent listings can each produce at most one Crate
;End                
                  

; ***Now define the CrateData you mentioned in the Die modules

; The CreationChance is the only required field, the other two are optional.  1.0 for Chance means always
;CrateData TestCrate
;  CreationChance = 0.75  ; Between 0 and 1, this adds a random condition to this entire CrateData
;  VeterancyLevel = ELITE  ; REGULAR, VETERAN, ELITE, or HEROIC: This describes the victim holding the CrateDie
;  KilledByType = SALVAGER  ; This is the KINDOF that needs to be the killer to make the crate.  This should be on the Missile as well as the Missile firing unit
;
;  CrateObject = CrateTemplate 0.4  ; If all Conditions suceed, then this Object is created
;  CrateObject = CrateTemplate2 0.6 ; The percent here should add up to 1.0, and allows multiple choices within the one CrateData
;
;  Utility Flags:
;  OwnedByMaker = Yes, to have the Crate assigned to the default team of the dead guy's player for scripting.
;End

; ***Now add one of the following CollideModules to the CrateTemplate below.

; ForbidOwnerPlayer = Yes  Works with OwnedByMaker (or by explicit ownership script) to prevent a certain 
; player from picking up the crate.  It can be used in any CrateCollide.

; BuildingPickup = Yes lets the crate be picked up by a building, for plane drops.  It can be used in any CrateCollide.

; HumanOnly = Yes let's the crate only be picked up by Humans, mostly for scripted stuff

; PickupScience   Forces the player owning the unit trying to get the crate to have a certain science.

; Only some of these have CollideData.
;Behavior = HealCrateCollide ; A crate that heals everything you own, no Data
;    ;nothing
;End ; 

;Behavior = MoneyCrateCollide ; A crate that gives x dollars
;;  MoneyProvided = 2000
;End

;  Behavior = SalvageCrateCollide
;    WeaponChance = 100%           ; If we are WeaponSalvager, this is the chance we get a WeaponSet upgrade if not fully upgraded
;    LevelChance = 25%             ; Either we are just a regular Salvager, or we are fully upgraded.  This is the chance we gain a level
;    MoneyChance = 75%             ; And this is the chance we get money.  Level + Money = 100%.  Weapon is an idependant FirstChance
;    MinMoney = 25                 ; If we get money, this is how much we get.  Make them different to get a random range.
;    MaxMoney = 75
;  End ; A crate specific to the SALVAGER type units

;Behavior = ShroudCrateCollide ; A crate that reveals the whole shroud on the map, no Data
